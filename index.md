   Currently I mainly study in optical imaging through scattering medium and phase 
 retrieval based on traditional algorithms as well as deep learning. 


# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

  Master：Mainly study in the radiation detection based on CMOS/CCD sensor. 
  
 1、Based on the CMOS and ARM, research in the image under low-energy Gamma radiation. The experiment was carried out at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
 2、Based on the CMOS, research in the image under X-ray. The experiment was carried out at Chongqing Cancer Hospital.

Mainly study in speckle pattern based on autocorrelation via traditional algorithms and deep learning.

1、Recovering object from speckle pattern which is imaging through multiple scattering media. Focused on multiple scattering media, low-resolution and high-noise, I propose a new method, using the autocorrelation as a bridge to recover object from low-resolution and noised speckle pattern. This method utilized autocorrelation as physical constraints has ability to solve ill-posed inverse problem and improve the robustness to noise. 
2、Reconstructing object imaging in complex scene from its autocorrelation via traditional algorithms and convolutional neural network. Only via CNN, the MNIST-Fashion and Berkeley Segmentation Dataset have been successfully recovered preliminary. My manuscript is in writing.
So my next work is improving the evaluation indicators in MNIST-Fashion, utilizing traditional algorithms and machine language to recover natural image.
