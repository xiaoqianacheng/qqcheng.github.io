   Currently I mainly study in optical imaging through scattering medium and phase 
 retrieval based on traditional algorithms as well as deep learning.

## Low-resolution and high-noise scattering imaging with Autocorrelation based on Deep Learning

   Recovering object from speckle pattern which is imaging through multiple scattering media. Focused on multiple scattering media, low-resolution and high-noise, I propose a new method, using the autocorrelation as a bridge to recover object from low-resolution and noised speckle pattern. This method utilized autocorrelation as physical constraints has ability to solve ill-posed inverse problem and improve the robustness to noise. 

## Reconstructing object imaging in complex scene from its autocorrelation via traditional algorithms and convolutional neural network.
   Only via CNN, the MNIST-Fashion and Berkeley Segmentation Dataset have been successfully recovered preliminary. My manuscript is in writing.
So my next work is improving the evaluation indicators in MNIST-Fashion, utilizing traditional algorithms and machine language to recover natural image.
